I created a Pokedex using the PokeAPI and the PokemonTCG API. You are able to
search any pokemon name or id and it will return with a picture and some info
about the pokemon. There are buttons that allow the user to scroll through pokemon
one by one. The PokeAPI does most the work when retrieving the information,
but the PokemonTCG API is the one responsible for getting and displaying the card.
Some pokemon do not have cards or their names do not match what is on the card.
the PokemonTCG API takes the name from the PokeAPI and is able to search for the
card based on the PokeAPI's info.

## Part 2: New

> What is something new and/or exciting that you learned from working
> on this project?

I learned a lot about how API's work and interact with eachother. It was super fun
to try and connect the two API's and to figure out in general how to get the information.
I also learned a lot about color in Javafx. I was able to fully color a lot of my project which
added to the enjoyment. I will totally be trying out more work with API's in the future just for fun and maybe even
looking into some harder ones to implement.

## Part 3: Retrospect

> If you could start the project over from scratch, what do
> you think might do differently and why?

I should have planned more on how I wanted the project to look at first. I had come up
with a general plan of how I wanted it to function, but without a design it was hard
to get working. Plus Its much harder to rearrange it all where I want when I have all the information.
